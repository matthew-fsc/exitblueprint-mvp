# Docs index

Start here. Docs are grouped by what you're trying to do. The **Status** column
says how to read each one:

- **Canonical** — the source of truth; read before building the thing it covers.
- **Reference** — durable, current background.
- **Strategy** — product/positioning reasoning (Matthew-owned); direction, not build spec.
- **Runbook** — ordered operational steps.
- **Log** — append-only history.

Point-in-time audits and superseded runbooks have been moved to
[`archive/`](./archive/) — see the bottom of this file.

> **Doc-numbering note.** Doc numbers are referenced from source code (top-of-file
> `// docs/NN` pointers, `render.yaml`, scripts), so numbers are stable and never
> reused. Archived docs keep their number under `archive/`.
>
> ⚠️ **Number collision — needs Matthew.** Two docs currently share number **41**:
> [`41-advisor-library-research-plan.md`](./41-advisor-library-research-plan.md)
> (registered as `docs/41` in the decisions log, 2026-07-21) and
> [`41-legal-counsel-talking-points.md`](./41-legal-counsel-talking-points.md)
> (added the same day with no decisions-log entry). Numbering is Matthew-owned —
> one of these needs a fresh, never-reused number assigned. Not resolved here.

## Find the code fast — feature → where it lives

A developer index: the durable features and the files that own them. Pair with
[28-architecture-map](./28-architecture-map.md) (the visual module map) and
[27-engineering-patterns](./27-engineering-patterns.md) (how to add one).

| --- | --- | --- |
| [40-vision-and-business-integration](./40-vision-and-business-integration.md) | Horizon frame above the apex — the three loops (product/business/ops) as one nervous system; dogfooding; moats as the financial thesis | Strategy |
| [20-strategic-positioning](./20-strategic-positioning.md) | Apex strategy — intelligence layer above advisory workflows; 7-layer moat | Strategy |

> These strategy docs overlap by design (20 is the apex; 09 is its moat detail; 18
> & 36 are the practitioner/go-to-market layer and overlap most with each other).
> They're cross-linked rather than merged so each keeps its own argument intact.

> **Clerk** (identity/MFA), **Render** (compute), **Vercel** (frontend), **Stripe**
> (billing), **Anthropic** (narrative) — with Supabase no longer credited for
> authentication. Keep the three in sync when the vendor set changes.
